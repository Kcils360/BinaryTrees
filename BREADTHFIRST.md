This took around an hour of actual research and work. We used this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU_ugVTSjSE as a resourse too.I first
tried using some while loops and nested if statements, but it wasn't working.  So we dug into the video a little, after asking around we
learned that we were alowed to use the built in Queue methods.  That helped, we got it pretty quickly after that.
